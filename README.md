This project aims to analyze IPL data from 2008 to 2024 and predict the winner of the 2025 IPL season using machine learning techniques. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into team and player performance, seasonal trends, and key match statistics. The dataset, consisting of matches.csv and deliveries.csv, is used to visualize important metrics such as win rates, batting and bowling performances, and match outcomes. Advanced machine learning models, including an ensemble approach combining Random Forest and XGBoost, are employed to predict the 2025 IPL winner. Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess performance. Additionally, neural networks are explored to enhance prediction accuracy. This project showcases the application of data science and machine learning in sports analytics, providing valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts and analysts.
